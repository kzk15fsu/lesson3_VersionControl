            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are also referred to as Revision Control or Source control management.  They're helpful for users so they can hold a plethora of past versions of files.  Further, version control benefits groups or multiple users who collaborate on a single file.  It prevents overwriting and allows all users to see the revision history of who changed what in a given project.  An example of a version control sytem is Git, which I'm learning and utilizing in class currently.  Many big, well-known companies utilize version control systems such as Git, so I enjoy being able to learn about this now for when I go into the workforce after college.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git works differently from other version control systems because of the way in which is reads the data.  Many version control systems store the information as different sets of files.  Git, however, stores data like snapshots of a file system that references back to the changes made.  Many operations utilized through Git is local which can lead to faster processing with ease for completing and working on projects.  Utilizing Git also only has three states that data can reside in: committed (data is stored locally), modified (changed data that has yet to be committed) and staged (a modified file that has been marked to go into the next committed snapshot).  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To a put a current project under version control, you need to use a repository.  However, first, there must be a basic framework for this.  This is done using a subdirectory.  The subdirectory assists in initializing the repository in an already existing directory.  This is not the only way of creating a repository.  A user can also clone an existing repository.  This is something useful if, for example, you are collaborating and want to contribute to an already existing project.  The command "git clone" copies all versions of the files.  This can also be helpful if a server crashes.  You can use this to bring up a past version of the server. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Impact of VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Anyone who needs to create, save, edit, and resave things can utilize version control.  Some examples of users would be  software developers, document authors, and designers.  The benefits for individual users are quite straightforward, such as tracking history.  But the true benefits of these in the workplace come in collaboration with others.  Version control systems such as Git allow merging features.  When users see who is changing what simultaneously in data, these VCS programs allow for easier analysis of what versions to maintain.  This is where the merge feature is helpful.  VCS reminds me of very elementary programs such as Google documents because it allows for collaborative efforts and you can revert back changes.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Being able to visualize the GIt basics through an online program is very helpful in understanding the basis of this new concept.  It provides diagrams to allow me to understand what committing and creating branches does.  I like this because it helps those who may be more visual learners.  This tool is helpful similarly to being able to use Cloud9 to code along in class because it is interactive.  Being able to directly work with a variety of programs and concepts we learn in class only strengthens my understanding of it.  </p>
